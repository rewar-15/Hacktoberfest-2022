## Application Logic and Implementations

To connect two users over WebRTC, we exchange information to allow browsers to talk to each other. This process is called signaling and it is facilitated by using NodeJS and socket server chained to the express 4.0 engine to provide the plumbing. Other than signaling, no data has to be sent through a server. When a connection is successfully established and authentication and authorization are complete, stream data exchanged between peers is directed to a ejs component for rendering.
